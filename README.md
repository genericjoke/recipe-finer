Our application is designed to contain a list of recipes that the user can choose from.
We have also implemented an allergen filtering function that will remove any recipe that contains or is made with one or more of the selected allergens. This will then display a list of selected recipes that the user can click on to open the recipe card.
We have also included a form that will allow the user to add their own recipe to the list.
